# What is this App for?

When you realize that the stock you bought has lost 5%, you will consider selling it, but at this time you don't know at what price to buy again, or at what price to sell to ensure that you don't lose your principal or even gain extra profit. This app is to help you solve this confusion. You need to enter a series of information, such as the number of shares you initially held, the price and total amount you sold at that time, the amount you intend to reinvest and the amount you sold. Based on past trends you can draw trend lines and support lines/zones and resistance lines/zones, then you determine a buy or sell price based on your analysis and the app will calculate the sell or buy price for you accordingly. Of course you also need to provide the name of the stock and the profit target (in percentile, must be greater than or equal to 0).

**This app does not contain recommendations for any stocks. Please invest with caution. NO FOMO.**
